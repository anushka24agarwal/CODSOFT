## Task 1: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow

## Task 2: TIC-TAC-TOE AI
Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toeagainst a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax withor without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.This project will help you understand game theory and basic searchalgorithms.

## Task 3: IMAGE CAPTIONING
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.<br>

## TASK 4: RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.

## TASK 5: FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION
Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace. <br>
