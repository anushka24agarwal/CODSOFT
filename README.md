## Task 3: IMAGE CAPTIONING
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.

## TASK 4: RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.

## TASK 5: FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION
Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
